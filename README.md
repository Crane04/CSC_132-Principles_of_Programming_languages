In Lagos State University, there is a course that introduces computer science students to the principle of programming using python and C
This course covers alot of terminologies and concepts that students find difficult to translate into written codes
As a result of  this, The Repository was created to help translate hard theoretical concept into practical application using codes
This repository explains underlying principles about varieties of programming language jargons and how and when they can be used
In every file or code, there exists a comprehensive comment used in explaining each concept before the actual code is written
